# Waat is it ?
This is a boilerplate for a simple web app.
Use this when you need to prototype a "page" and keep things simple.

An example could be you need to test a new js or css library but you don't want to use biolerplate like Create-React-App.

## Supports
- ES6 (import /export in .js/ts file)
- SASS
- Typescript
- JSX (if not work read next section)
